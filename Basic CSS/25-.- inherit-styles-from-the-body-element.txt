<!--
  Every HTML page has a "body" element, and that its body element can also be styled with CSS.
  Remember, you can style your body element just like any other HTML element, and all your other elements will inherit your body element's styles.
  Here, we set the background black, the color and font-family for the whole page is set on the body element.

<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    color: green;
    font-family: monospace;
