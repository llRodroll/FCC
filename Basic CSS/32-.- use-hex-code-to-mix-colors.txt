<!--
  Hex codes use 6 hexadecimal digits to represent colors, two each for red (R), green (G), and blue (B) components.

For example, orange is pure red, mixed with some green, and no blue. In hex code, this translates to being #FFA500.

#000000 is black: # 00 (red) 00 (green) 00 (blue)

The digit 0 is the lowest number in hex code, and represents a complete absence of color.

The digit F is the highest number in hex code, and represents the maximum possible brightness.
